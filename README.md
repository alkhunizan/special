# Prompt Library

A simple static site for browsing and copying pre-built prompts. The prompts are stored in `prompts.js` and rendered on the page with basic search and category filtering.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the library. Edit `prompts.js` to add, remove, or modify prompt entries.
