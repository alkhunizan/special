# Prompt Library

A simple static site for browsing and copying pre-built prompts. The prompts are stored in `prompts.js` and rendered on the page with basic search and category filtering. Users can switch between English and Najdi Arabic and experiment with the built-in AI prompt generator placeholder.

## Usage

Open `index.html` in a browser to view the library. Edit `prompts.js` to add, remove, or modify prompt entries. The generator section posts to `/api/generate` so you can wire up an API later.
